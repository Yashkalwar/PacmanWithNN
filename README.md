So for this we have to use "Sophisticated Classifier" according to the conditions for the pacman. After thinking about 0.2 secs, I decided there could'd be a better classifier than a Neural network. But there was a catch, we can use any predefined libraries except numpy and sklearn. So I had already decided, so I had to do itwith NN only.
